# HONESTY NOTE: the mt1 campaign was driven by ad-hoc bash loops typed at a
# prompt. These are cleaned-up equivalents that perform the same measurements in
# the same order with the same parameters -- not a verbatim transcript. They are
# here so the campaign is reproducible from the repository, which it was not:
# every SQL file and driver loop lived only in /tmp inside a pod that no longer
# exists.
#
# Requires: kubectl with a context on the lab cluster, and the release deployed
# in namespace $NS with origin, pgcache and loadgen at 1 replica each.

# ── Warm-up ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION HERE. Repeats passes until the hit ratio stops
# climbing, and reports how many it took.
#
# A FIXED warm-up pass has produced a wrong published result three separate
# times on this platform. The worst was campaign r5: 52 runs each recorded 45 s
# of warm-up while the hit ratio was still climbing at 2m30, and nine cells of
# the conclusion had to be retracted. The most recent was the ten-shape probe,
# where one 15 s pass made a plain primary-key lookup appear to reach only a
# 19.5% hit ratio and lose by 42%; with adequate warm-up the same cell reaches
# 100% and wins by 38%.
#
# The settling threshold is one percentage point between consecutive passes.
